Distributed Node
================

The Distributed Node class is a specialized Distributed Object and defines
functions available from PandaNodes like position and rotation. Simply check the
direct.dc file to see which network calls are available.

This DO can be used if the repository has been initialized with the direct.dc
added to the dc files list.
